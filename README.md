run the "Example: make new plugin" command and name your plugin.

read the `.cljs` file that opens, that's the meat of the plugin. it shows how LightTable works.

connect your local repo to a remote repo with:

    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git remote add origin git@github.com:USER/PLUGIN.git
    git push -u origin master

and start editing!
